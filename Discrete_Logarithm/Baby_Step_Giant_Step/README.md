# Baby-Step, Giant-Step Algorithm

1) q1.py
	Naive approach, complexity of O(p). 

2) q1Array.py
	Use an array, space tradeoff, complexity of O(p^1/2).
	Use iCurr.txt and iValue.txt to keep track of progress

3) maybe.py
	Used to run on multiple CPUs to speed up progess

4) gen.py
	Generate x and check answer
	
5) result.txt
	Store results
