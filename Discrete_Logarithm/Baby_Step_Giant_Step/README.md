# Baby-Step, Giant-Step Algorithm

1) q1.py  
	Naive approach, complexity of O(p).  

2) q1Array.py  
	Use an array, space tradeoff, complexity of O(p^1/2).  
	Use iCurr.txt and iValue.txt to keep track of progress

3) maybe.py  
	Used to run on multiple CPUs to speed up progess

4) gen.py  
	Generate x and check answer

5) result.txt  
	Store results
