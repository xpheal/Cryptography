# Two_Prime_Factorization

Find semi prime factors  

Find x and y given z where  
z = x*y  
x and y are both prime factors  

1) prime.py  
	Find both primes using an optimize naive approach

2) primeloop.py  
	Keep track of progress and used to run on multiple CPUs

3) psquareprime.py  
	Calculate the prime numbers iff next (perfect square - N) is a perfect square
